Represents an [XML 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) document as a read-only tree.

```rust
// Find element by id.
let doc = roxmltree::Document::parse("<rect id='rect1'/>").unwrap();
let elem = doc.descendants().find(|n| n.attribute("id") == Some("rect1")).unwrap();
assert!(elem.has_tag_name("rect"));
```

## Why read-only?

Because in some cases all you need is to retrieve some data from an XML document.
And for such cases, we can make a lot of optimizations.

As for *roxmltree*, it's fast not only because it's read-only, but also because
it uses [xmlparser], which is many times faster than [xml-rs].
See the [Performance](#performance) section for details.

## Parsing behavior

Sadly, XML can be parsed in many different ways. *roxmltree* tries to mimic the
behavior of Python's [lxml](https://lxml.de/).
But unlike *lxml*, *roxmltree* does support comments outside the root element.

For more details see [docs/parsing.md](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree/blob/master/docs/parsing.md).

Legend:

- ✓ - supported
- × - parsing error
- ~ - partial
- *nothing* - not supported

Notes:

1. No default namespace propagation.
2. *roxmltree* keeps all node and attribute positions in the original document,
   so you can easily retrieve it if you need it.
   See [examples/print_pos.rs](examples/print_pos.rs) for details.
3. In the `memchr` crate.
4. Binary size overhead according to [cargo-bloat](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/cargo-bloat).
5. Depends on build flags.

There is also `elementtree` and `treexml` crates, but they are abandoned for a long time.

test medium_xmltree      ... bench:   8,083,860 ns/iter (+/- 25,363)

test tiny_xmltree        ... bench:      29,522 ns/iter (+/- 223)
```

*roxmltree* uses [xmlparser] internally,
while *sdx-document* uses its own implementation,
*xmltree* uses the [xml-rs]
and *minidom* uses [quick-xml].
Here is a comparison between *xmlparser*, *xml-rs* and *quick-xml*:

```text
test large_quick_xml     ... bench:   1,286,273 ns/iter (+/- 27,174)
test large_xmlparser     ... bench:   1,742,202 ns/iter (+/- 11,616)
test large_xmlrs         ... bench:  19,615,797 ns/iter (+/- 105,848)

test medium_quick_xml    ... bench:     248,169 ns/iter (+/- 3,885)
test medium_xmlparser    ... bench:     386,658 ns/iter (+/- 1,721)
test medium_xmlrs        ... bench:   7,387,753 ns/iter (+/- 18,668)

test tiny_quick_xml      ... bench:       2,382 ns/iter (+/- 29)
test tiny_xmlparser      ... bench:       2,788 ns/iter (+/- 20)
test tiny_xmlrs          ... bench:      27,619 ns/iter (+/- 262)
```

### Iteration

```text
test xmltree_iter_descendants_expensive     ... bench:     436,684 ns/iter (+/- 7,851)
test roxmltree_iter_descendants_expensive   ... bench:     470,459 ns/iter (+/- 6,233)
test minidom_iter_descendants_expensive     ... bench:     785,847 ns/iter (+/- 51,495)

test roxmltree_iter_descendants_inexpensive ... bench:      36,759 ns/iter (+/- 684)
test xmltree_iter_descendants_inexpensive   ... bench:     168,541 ns/iter (+/- 1,885)
test minidom_iter_descendants_inexpensive   ... bench:     215,615 ns/iter (+/- 38,101)
```

Where expensive refers to the matching done on each element. In these
benchmarks, *expensive* means searching for any node in the document which
contains a string. And *inexpensive* means searching for any element with a
particular name.

### Notes

You can try running the benchmarks yourself by running `cargo bench` in the `benches` dir.

- Since all libraries have a different XML support, benchmarking is a bit pointless.
- Tree crates may use different *xml-rs* crate versions.
- We do not bench the libxml2, because `xmlReadFile()` will parse only an XML structure,
  without attributes normalization and stuff. So it's hard to compare.
  And we have to use a separate benchmark utility.
- *quick-xml* is faster than *xmlparser* because it's more forgiving for the input,
  while *xmlparser* is very strict and does a lot of checks, which are expensive.
  So performance difference is mainly due to validation.

## Safety

- This library must not panic. Any panic should be considered a critical bug and reported.
- This library forbids `unsafe` code.

## Non-goals

- Complete XML support.
- Tree modification and writing.
- XPath/XQuery.

## API

This library uses Rust's idiomatic API based on iterators.
In case you are more familiar with browser/JS DOM APIs - you can check out
[tests/dom-api.rs](tests/dom-api.rs) to see how it can be converted into a Rust one.
