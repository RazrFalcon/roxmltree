Represents an [XML 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) document as a read-only tree.

```rust
// Find element by id.
let doc = roxmltree::Document::parse("<rect id='rect1'/>")?;
let elem = doc.descendants().find(|n| n.attribute("id") == Some("rect1"))?;
assert!(elem.has_tag_name("rect"));
```

## Why read-only?

Because in some cases all you need is to retrieve some data from an XML document.
And for such cases, we can make a lot of optimizations.

## Parsing behavior

Sadly, XML can be parsed in many different ways. *roxmltree* tries to mimic the
behavior of Python's [lxml](https://lxml.de/).
For more details see [docs/parsing.md](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree/blob/master/docs/parsing.md).

Legend:

- ✓ - supported
- × - parsing error
- ~ - partial
- *nothing* - not supported

Notes:

1. No default namespace propagation.
2. *roxmltree* keeps all node and attribute positions in the original document,
   so you can easily retrieve it if you need it.
   See [examples/print_pos.rs](examples/print_pos.rs) for details.

There is also `elementtree` and `treexml` crates, but they are abandoned for a long time.

## Performance

```

When comparing to streaming XML parsers `roxmltree` is slightly slower than `quick-xml`,
but still way faster than `xmlrs`.
Note that streaming parsers usually do not provide a proper string unescaping,
DTD resolving and namespaces support.

test tiny_xmlrs          ... bench:      17,155 ns/iter (+/- 429)
```

### Notes

The benchmarks were taken on a Apple M1 Pro.
You can try running the benchmarks yourself by running `cargo bench` in the `benches` dir.

- Since all libraries have a different XML support, benchmarking is a bit pointless.
- We bench *libxml2* using the *[rust-libxml]* wrapper crate

## Memory overhead

`roxmltree` tries to use as little memory as possible to allow parsing
very large (multi-GB) XML files.

The peak memory usage doesn't directly correlate with the file size
but rather with the amount of nodes and attributes a file has.
How many attributes had to be normalized (i.e. allocated).
And how many text nodes had to be preprocessed (i.e. allocated).

`roxmltree` never allocates element and attribute names, processing instructions
and comments.

By disabling the `positions` feature, you can shave 8 bytes from each node and attribute.

On average, the overhead is around 6-8x the file size.
For example, our 1.1GB sample XML will peak at 7.6GB RAM with default features enabled
and at 6.8GB RAM when `positions` is disabled.

## Safety

- This library must not panic. Any panic should be considered a critical bug and reported.
- This library forbids `unsafe` code.

## API

This library uses Rust's idiomatic API based on iterators.
In case you are more familiar with browser/JS DOM APIs - you can check out
[tests/dom-api.rs](tests/dom-api.rs) to see how it can be mapped onto the Rust one.
